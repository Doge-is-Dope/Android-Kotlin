# Android App Design

##### Technical Concerns
- Rotation handling: Does the data survive when the device is rotated?
- Offline cache: Is the data still available during offline?
- Data validation: Is the data correct?

##### Accessibility
- Vision impairment: Does the app work for color blinded? Does the view size perfectly for the resolution?
- Input device: Is there any case that a user can't touch the screen?
- Right-To-Left Support
- Test the app using [Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor&hl=en_US),

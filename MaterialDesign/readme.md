##### Technical Concerns
- Rotation handling: Does the data survive when the device is rotated?
- Offline cache: Is the data still available during offline?
- Data validation: Is the data correct?

##### Accessibility
- Vision impairment: Does the app work for color blinded? Does the view size perfectly for the resolution?
- Input device: Is there any case that a user can't touch the screen?
